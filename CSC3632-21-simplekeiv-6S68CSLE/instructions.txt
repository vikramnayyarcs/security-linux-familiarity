You have to break the protocol in order to get your flag.

The protocol is similar in nature to the simpleke challenge, so make sure you solved simpleke first!

- There are two machines playing the protocol: A and B.
- The protocol aims to let A and B exchange a secret session key and a secret message.

The main difference with simpleke is that in this version, the programmer decided to use AES a bit more securely, by using a proper Initialisation Vector. The resulting approach is more complex than what is used in the aes challenge or the simpleke or complexke challenge. 

However, luckily, you are also provided with a code fragment that is currently used in the code to manage the encryption and decryption in crypto_fragment.php. Note that this is PHP code, and will not run directly in the command line ...


As before, you are provided with a specific version of that protocol, which is deployed at a specific address, provided in the script protocol.sh which executes the protocol cleanly in the way it was meant to run. 
  If you are struggling, try to solve first simpleke, complexke and the web-based game from the link above, step by step.
