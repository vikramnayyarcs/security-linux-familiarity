Computational challenges is a tool used by a server to mitigate DoS attack:
the server requests the client to solve a puzzle before enabling the
connection. This will slow down the attack but will also provide a negative
incentive for the attacker, since computing the puzzle can be expensive.
See e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.11021.pdf for further details if you are
interested (note: reading this article is NOT needed to solve the CTF!). 

In this CTF, you have to handle a server that uses a new type of challenge:
it provides you will a table of k-anonymity equal to 1, and asks the client
to compute a modification to the table respecting some expected k-anonymity,
which will change every time the page is loaded.

To make things more challenging, the server only allows one attempt every 10
minutes, and forces the answer to be provided within 2 seconds.

Your specific address is: 

http://10.0.0.5/ctf_deploy2/kchal/Clyhbjgi/JGWPPWTCHR.php

If you can solve the k-anonymity challenge within 2 seconds, you should get
the flag!
