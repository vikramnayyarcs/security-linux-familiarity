AC Attack.



You are provided with a binary file "getflag" which contacts a PDP server
with some access control attributes, and if the PDP server permits the request,
then "getflag" will output the flag (which is stored in the binary file). 

The first time you attempt this CTF on a machine, you first need to run
"sudo sh setup.sh", which will configure the right IP address for
the PDP server. 

For added security, getflag and the pdp use a shared secret and a nonce in the
communication. Assuming getflag runs on the agent A, the protocol is:

Initial Knowledge
A: [Attributes, Secret]
PDP: [Decision, Secret]

Steps
1. A -> PDP: Attributes, #NA
2. PDP -> A: Decision, MD5(Decision + Secret + NA)

where "+" denotes string concatenation. The Secret is a string of exactly two
uppercase letters. For instance, if the secret is AB, the nonce is DEFG and the
decision is Deny, the PDP will return Deny, MD5("DenyABDEFG"). Since getflag
knows the secret and the nonce, it can compute the MD5 hash to ensure that the
decision from the PDP server is indeed Permit, in which case it will print the
flag.

Good luck!
