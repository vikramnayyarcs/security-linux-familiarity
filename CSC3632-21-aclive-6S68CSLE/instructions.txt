Live Policy Evaluation. 

You are provided with a specific policy provided in the attached file.
  This policy can be evaluated using a specific script (also provided in the attached file), where attribute values of the policy are passed as GET parameters.

For instance, A.php?AAAA=True&BBBB=False will evaluate your policy with the values True for the attribute AAAA and False for BBBB. Attributes with no values are considered to be unknown.

Your objective is to find a combination of attributes such that the policy evaluates to True, and you will get the flag.
